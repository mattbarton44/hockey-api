  games new / edit -> events and stats need doing

pages to do:

  edit season
  
  create api functions suited for widgets
    -> filters on games, upcoming, completed etc, or certain teams
    -> standings calculated on server side?
    

  redo clubs and teams pages
  
  add way to add players to rosters via text area list

  create defaults for competittions
    - default new game type => league
    - default new game status => upcoming


  -- need to implement user / permissions system eventually
    - certain tasks need to be locked behind permissions that are used on both client and server side
      - competitions
        - add competition
        - edit competition
          - seasons
            - create season
            - edit season
            - add game
            - edit game
            - delete game
            - update game result
            - spawn All games
            - add team
            - delete team
    
    - maybe use roles here instead of individual user to permission matrix




should game status be implicit??

upcoming = has time but it's in the future
tbc = has no time
completed = has score_type?

postponed not covered?

      // 'status' => '', // [ UPCOMING, COMPLETED, POSTPONED, TBC ] 



      do game result card
      do single fixture card
